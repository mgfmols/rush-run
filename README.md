## Important to know
When playing the game, save data for the leaderboard is stored using **PlayerPrefs**, meaning data is stored in the Windows Registry.
When using Unity to open the project, any Play Mode data is stored at `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Unity\UnityEditor\DefaultCompany\Rush Run`
and when making a build, the data is stored at `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\DefaultCompany\Rush Run`.

## About the project
This project was a duo project, meaning I built this project together with one teammate.
The game was meant to be a speedrun game. The whole point is to get to the end as fast as possible.
We created multiple paths to the end and some paths are clearly faster than others.

## My contribution
I was partly responsible for the design of the entire game. I developed the leaderboard system, powerups and randomization grid at the end of the only level.
